# üßπ Data Cleaning Project Using SQL ‚Äî Layoffs Dataset

This project showcases a **complete SQL data cleaning process** performed on a real-world dataset (`layoffs.csv`).  
The goal of this project is to transform messy and inconsistent data into a clean, analysis-ready format using **MySQL**.  

This cleaning workflow follows a structured approach:
- Removing duplicates  
- Standardizing inconsistent values  
- Handling null or blank values  
- Converting data types  
- Dropping unnecessary columns
